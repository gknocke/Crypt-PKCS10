==================================
	Crypt::PKCS10 is a small command line utility for parsing
	PKCS #10 requests to perl data structure.

INSTALLATION

       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires:

      Convert::ASN1

NAME
	Crypt::PKCS10 - Parses PKCS #10 requests

SYNOPSIS
	use Crypt::PKCS10;

	$decoded = CSR->new($csr);
	$version = $decoded->version;
	
DESCRIPTION
	Crypt::PKCS10 parses certificate signing requests to perl
	data structure and provides accessor methods to supported
	elements.

	It is based on the generic ASN.1 module by Graham Barr and on the
    x509decode example by Norbert Klasen. It is also based upon the
    works of Duncan Segrests Crypt-X509-CRL module.

    Note: The module parses common fields and extensions. Some
    fields might be missing.

CONSTRUCTOR
	new ( FILE )
		Takes a variable containing the PEM or DER formatted
		PKCS #10 request and returns a hash of it.

		Example:
			use Crypt::PKCS10;
			use Data::Dumper;
			$Data::Dumper::Useqq = 1;

			$decoded = CSR->new($csr);

			print Dumper $decoded;

METHODS
	The most common fields have own accessor methods. It is also
	possible to access these fields directly using the hash, though.
	Some methods transform the fields in order to provide printable
	strings.

	The following methods are implemented:

	* version
		Returns v1, v2 or v3 indicating the version.

	* commonName

	* organizationalUnitName

	* emailAddress

	* stateOrProvinceName

	* countryName

	* pkAlgorithm

	* subjectPublicKey
		Returns subjectPublicKey in its hex representation.

	* signatureAlgorithm

	* signature
		Returns signatur in its hex representation.

	* attributes
		Returns a HASH containing the attributes.

		Example:
			%attributes = $decoded->attributes;
			print Dumper(\%attributes);

	* certificateTemplate
		A Microsoft specific extension.
